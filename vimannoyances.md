# Vim Annoyances
Things I need to figure out:
* Buffergator previous buffer
* Arpeggios don't work in replace mode currently
* Add some useful abbreviations with iabbrev
* Haskell step debugging
* Haskell hoogle lookups. Compare haskellmode to vim2hs
* Auto git checkin for vimannoyances.md and vimstickies.md on save event
* filetype autocommand mappings: commentline, commentblock etc. (chapter 12 vimscript hard way)
