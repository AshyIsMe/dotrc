# Vim Annoyances

Things I need to figure out:

* http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3037 - vim-indent-object indent based text-objects
* Go vimrc mining here: http://amix.dk/vim/vimrc.html
* https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter
* Does CtrlP have a feature for currently open buffers?
* Arpeggios don't work in replace mode currently. 
* Add some useful abbreviations with iabbrev
* filetype autocommand mappings: commentline, commentblock etc. (chapter 12 vimscript hard way)
* Autocmd to commit and push vimstickynotes.md and vimannoyances.md on :write 
* http://superuser.com/questions/444643/remap-capslocktap-to-esc-and-capslockhold-to-ctrl-in-os-x-lion
* https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter
* https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline
* https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe

* Haskell 
** Step debugging?
** Haskell hoogle lookups. Compare haskellmode to vim2hs - check out the vim2hs "see also" section on github
** Haskell editing mode. look into this: https://github.com/chrisdone/structured-haskell-mode
