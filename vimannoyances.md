# Vim Annoyances
Things I need to figure out:
* statusline with a random line from vimstickynotes.md
* https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter
* Does CtrlP have a feature for currently open buffers?
* Arpeggios don't work in replace mode currently. 
* Arpeggio for ) breaks "th" in insert mode!!
* Add some useful abbreviations with iabbrev
* Haskell step debugging
* Haskell hoogle lookups. Compare haskellmode to vim2hs - check out the vim2hs "see also" section on github
* Haskell editing mode. look into this: https://github.com/chrisdone/structured-haskell-mode
* Autocmd to commit and push vimstickynotes.md and vimannoyances.md on :write
